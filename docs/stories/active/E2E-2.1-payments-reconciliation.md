# Story E2E-2.1: Payment reconciliation and delinquency

**Epic:** FINHEALTH-EPIC-2 (E2E Test Expansion)
**Sprint:** 2 — Financial + Data Entry
**Points:** 3
**Priority:** High
**Status:** Pending
**Agent:** @dev

## Context

Payment reconciliation (conciliacao bancaria) is the critical financial operation that matches payments from insurers against billed accounts. The delinquency view tracks overdue payments. Both have zero E2E coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test payments list page renders table with columns
- [ ] Test payment detail page (/pagamentos/[id]) renders payment info and matched accounts
- [ ] Test reconciliation page (/pagamentos/conciliacao) renders summary cards (total, matched, difference, pending)
- [ ] Test delinquency page (/pagamentos/inadimplencia) renders overdue items
- [ ] Test payment status filtering
- [ ] Test payment file upload interaction (if applicable)
- [ ] Create Page Object Models: `e2e/pages/payments-list.page.ts`, `e2e/pages/reconciliation.page.ts`

## Technical Notes

- Depends on E2E-1.1 (auth fixture)
- Seed payments with different reconciliation statuses: pending, partial, matched
- Reconciliation page shows 4 summary cards — verify all render with correct data

## Files to Create

- `e2e/payments.spec.ts`
- `e2e/pages/payments-list.page.ts`
- `e2e/pages/reconciliation.page.ts`

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Payment list and detail views tested
- [ ] Reconciliation summary renders correctly
- [ ] Delinquency view renders correctly
- [ ] All tests pass in headless mode
